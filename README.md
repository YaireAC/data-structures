# Data-Structures

This repository contains my implementations of various assignments from my **Data Structures** course, where we explored **abstract data types** and their applications. Through this coursework, I strengthened my **C programming** skills by implementing and analyzing fundamental data structures, including:

## Topics Covered
- **Abstract Data Types & Essential Data Structures:**
  - Dynamic Arrays
  - Linked Lists
  - Stacks, Queues, and Deques
  - Trees
  - Hash Tables
  - Graphs
- **Complexity Analysis** of Data Structures and Their Operations
