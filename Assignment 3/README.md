# Data-Structures-Assignment-23
This is a program for the course Data Structures at Oregon State. This assignment was intended to have us explore non-linear data structures by implementing a binary search tree (BST). After implementing the BST, we solved some BST-based puzzle problems.

## Requirements

### BST Functionalities
- *`bst_create()`* correctly allocates and initializes a BST.
- *`bst_free()`* correctly frees the memory allocated to a BST with no memory leaks.
- *`bst_size()`* correctly determines the number of elements in a BST.
- *`bst_insert()`* correctly inserts a key/value pair into a BST, maintaining the BST property with respect to all keys in the tree.
- *`bst_remove()`* correctly removes a key/value pair from a BST based on a specified key, maintaining the BST property with respect to all keys in the tree.
- *`bst_get()`* correctly retrieves the value associated with a given key in a BST.

### BST "Puzzles"
- *`bst_height()`* correctly computes the height of a BST.
- *`bst_path_sum()`* correctly validates a path sum in a BST.

## Limitations of the program
- 1 wrong key/value at the last part of the test.
- Did not implement *`bst_range_path()`*.
